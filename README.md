## what is matching game
This is a simple game built to test a users's remembering ability. There's a deck of cards, the user is expected to macth all pairs of the same cards on the deck.

## challenge
the challenge is to macth the cards with less number of movies as fast as possible.


## Instructions
- click on a card to reveal its icon, then click on another card to check if they are of thesame type.
- keep keep clicking on pairs of card to reveal their icons
- make sure you remember the position of the revealed card on the deck incase they don't match
- try to use less moves as well also at a faster time.


## how the game was built
 A starter HTML and CSS  files were provided that had created the deck of cards, I basically wrote the javascript to manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS,
- created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
- created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
- added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
- create a modal to popup when  a player wins the game
